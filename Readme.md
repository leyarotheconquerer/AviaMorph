Bird-Shifter (Avia-Morph?)
==========================
This is a project for the [Ludum Dare 35](http://ludumdare.com/compo/). The
theme for this game jam is shapeshifter.

Concept
-------
You are the birdman Avia-Morph!

Your quest? Find the golden berries of destiny.

Before you stretches a bottomless world of island pillars. Find your way between
these havens by shapeshifting into your bird form.

But be careful, when in your bird form you use power from the bird berries you
find on the islands. If you run out of berries you will fall forever to the
bottomless depths.

Technical Details

This game is built using Unreal 4.11.1.

Art assets are constructed using Blender 2.77a and Krita 2.9.11.
